🦦 Otter Flow — Simple Feedback for Founders

Otter Flow is a lightweight feedback tool that founders can embed directly into their websites or web apps with just one line of code. It allows users to easily share feature requests, report issues, and upvote suggestions — all without creating an account.

For founders, Otter Flow offers a clean dashboard that collects and organizes all incoming feedback in one place, making it simple to spot popular requests, mark progress, and close the loop with users.
